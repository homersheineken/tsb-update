#######################################################################
                              Introduction
#######################################################################

Welcome!  You have reached utopia, otherwise known as the Tecmo Super 
Bowl Guide.  I have never before seen a guide to this game, so I said 
to myself, "Paul, you should write one, both to show old players that 
Tecmo Super Bowl is still fun, even after collecting several layers of 
dust, and also to introduce some new players to the glories of this 
underappreciated game."  Well, that and I had too much time on my 
hands.

You may be wondering which Tecmo I am covering in this FAQ.  The only 
Tecmo this covers is Tecmo Super Bowl for the old Nintendo.  This means
there is no information on Tecmo Bowl for NES, Tecmo Super Bowl I, II, 
or III for SNES or Genesis, and certainly no info on that crapfest that
has Tecmo's name on it for the PSX.  For all you lovers of the other 
Tecmos out there, I'm sorry.  I don't have the time nor the passion to 
write guides to all the other versions of Tecmo Super Bowl.

I am nearing the end of my sojourn into Tecmo Guide country.  There 
probably will be a Version 3, but right now I can't come up with much 
to put in it.  It will cover the cinemas and cutscenes at the beginning 
of the game and at the end, and also expanded scouting reports, but 
that more than likely will be the last version, unless I can get some 
good ideas on what else I should put in this guide.  I've been toying 
with the idea of putting professional football stats from 1991, but I 
need to know if anybody is interested in that.  If I get no feedback, 
I'll assume nobody cares.  I've done most of what I could think of to 
do, and anything I haven't done is included in Leif Powers' guide, 
which can be found at GameFAQs.com.  So, if anybody out there in 
Tecmoland has any great suggestions, feel free to email me at 
edgarffvi@yahoo.com and I'll see if I want to put it in my guide.


                         Abbreviations and Terms
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This guide uses many abbreviations, both relating to Tecmo 
specifically, and to football in general.  This is a listing of the 
abbreviations I used in this guide.

O-offense
   QB-quarterback
   RB-running back
      HB-halfback
      FB-fullback
   WR-wide receiver
   TE-tight end
   OL-offensive line or offensive lineman
      T-offensive tackle
      G-offensive guard
      C-center

D-defense
   DL-defensive line or defensive lineman
      DE-defensive end
      NT-nose tackle
   LB-linebacker
      ILB-inside linebacker
      OLB-outside linebacker
   DB-defensive back
      CB-cornerback
      S-safety
         SS-strong safety
         FS-free safety

NFL-National Football League
AFC-American Football Conference
NFC-National Football Conference

In this guide I also use the terms top and bottom to specify which 
player I am talking about if there happens to be more than one.  T and 
B represent top and bottom.  For instance, I will use TOLB to represent 
the outside linebacker closest to the top of the screen.  The game uses
right and left, but that situation can change depending on what goal 
you are facing.  

TSB or Tecmo-Tecmo Super Bowl for NES
   making popcorn-When a player throws off a defender with minimal 
      grappling while running with the ball.  When a player has 
      extremely high hitting power, they can often throw off would be 
      tacklers without significant slowdown.
   possessed-When a computer controlled defensive lineman or linebacker                   
      breaks through the line of scrimmage on every or nearly every
      play. Usually happens when the defender is in excellent 
      condition.
   Tecmo legend-A player who is a virtual unknown in real life, but is 
      one of the best on Tecmo.  A good example is Bob Nelson.  Has 
      anybody actually heard of this guy?  Yet he is a force on 
      defense.  He even has the capability to become possessed.
   glitch-A problem in gameplay that is obviously unintentional.  
      Common glitches in TSB include the fumble glitch, the bouncing 
      punt, and the inability of a man controlled player to recover a 
      fumble.
   nosetackle dive-The single cheapest move in the game.  The move 
      where the nosetackle dives at the quarterback through the line.  
      There is no defense against it, other than a fast quarterback or 
      choosing a different play.  Also called: the lurch, the bitch 
      move, the low blow.  (Thanks to M.E.Z. AKA Haddix4475)
   "playing above his stats"-This is a term for when a player seems to 
      be going much faster or hitting much harder than his stats 
      indicate.  One of my favorite players, Mosi Tatupu, fits this 
      definition because he is able to return kickoffs much better than
      his stats would have you think.  If a player is performing better 
      than should be possible according to his stats, he is "playing 
      above his stats.

Abbreviations ralating to individual players-
   rushing speed (RS)-How fast a player accelerates.  Found at all 
      positions.
   rushing power (RP)-This one is something of an enigma.  I think it 
      has something to do with how well a player can block.  Found at 
      all positions.
   maximum speed (MS)-How fast a player's top speed is.  Found at all 
      positions.
   hitting power (HP)-How well a player hits.  This also determines the
      player's ability to make popcorn (see above).  Found at all 
      positions.
   passing speed (PS)-How fast a quarterback's pass travels in the air.
      Found only at QB.
   pass control (PC)-This is another one I'm unsure of.  According to 
      beernut from the Tecmo Message Board (address at the end of this 
      guide) it is how well a quarterback can throw into coverage and 
      not get intercepted.  Found only at QB.
   accuracy of pass (AP)-How well a quarterback can hit his receiver 
      without overthrowing, underthrowing, or otherwise throwing the 
      ball badly.  Found only at QB.
   avoid pass block (APB)-Duh.  Found only at QB.
   ball control (BC)-How well a player can hold onto the ball; how 
      little he fumbles.  Found at RB, WR, and TE.
   receptions (RC)-How well a player catches.  Found at RB, WR, and TE.
   kicking ability (KA)-How well a player kicks, both in terms of 
      accuracy and distance.  Found at K and P.
   avoid kick block (AKB)-The ability to avoid having a kick blocked.
      Found at K and P.
   pass interceptions(PI)-The ability to intercept a pass.  Found at 
      all defensive positions.
   quickness (QC)-This has something to do with pass rushing.  I think 
      that it controls how fast a player gets off the snap.  According
      to Jeff Gaffney of the Tecmo message board, quickness also 
      determines how fast a defender can change direction.  Found at 
      all defensive postions. 
   C5, C6, C7, and C8-Category 5, 6, 7, and 8.  I use these when 
      referring to multiple positions.  These four categories differ 
      from position to position.  For example, the fifth category for a 
      quarterback is passing speed, while for a running back it is ball 
      control.
   Perc.-Percentile.  If you want more information, look under the 
      Scouting Reports area.
   Wk.-Week.
   Opp.-Opponent.
   !-Pro Bowler.
   *-Starter.
   T-Tied.
   sic-Spelling incorrect.  Amazingly, Tecmo missepelled quite a few       
names.

#######################################################################
                       Team and Individual Rankings
#######################################################################

The title pretty much sums up what this section includes.  I have 
ranked all the teams in term of offense and defense.  Also covered are 
all the individual players at each position.  At the beginning of each 
section, I have included the major factors in my decisions.  

I have ranked each team three different ways.  The first is 
subjectively, which is just my opinion.  The second is the "COM" 
version, using every individual player's percentile. (Finding 
percentiles is covered in the scouting reports section.) I took all the 
starters, added them together, added five times the average of the OL 
and backups, and added half the sum of the punter and kicker.  All 
values are rounded to the nearest whole number.  The final way is the 
"MAN" version, using a team's stars.  I only used the percentiles of 
the key positions.  I took the best starting RB, QB, receiver (WR or 
TE), DL, LB, and DB.  I added all those percentiles together and came 
up with the third number.  As a general rule, the better the MAN value, 
the better the team when controlled by a player.  For COM value, it 
applies more to the computer.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Points are the numbers listed in the individual player data screen. 
These points are also broken down into 6 or 7 point units called 
increments.  For example, a player can have 50 ball control or 56 ball 
control, but no numbers in between 50 and 56 are possible.  All points 
were taken while the players were in average condition.  For breakdowns
of the distribution of points, see the team area, where every player's 
stats are listed.

                              Quarterbacks 
Every team has two quarterbacks.

Facts Worth Noting

Indianapolis, New England, Pheonix,  and Detroit all have backups with 
better total point values than their starters.  In fact, Grogan on New 
England is the worst QB in the league, with George from Indianapolis 
close behind at third worst.  Both of these abysmal quarterbacks start.

49ers backup Steve Young is better than 17 starters, and he is also 49 
points better than the next best backup, Andre Ware for Detroit.

The AFC has 7 of the top 10 best QBs.

Every QB has 25 running speed, 69 rushing power, and 13 hitting power.

The default for quarterbacks seems to be 25 running speed, 69 rushing 
power, 13 maximum speed, 13 hitting power, 44 passing speed, 38 pass 
control, 31 pass accuracy, and 38 avoid pass block; for a total of 271 
points.  Nine quarterbacks have these exact stats, and all of them are 
backups.  My guess is that Tecmo gave these stats to anyone they didn't 
know very well.

To put QB Eagles' 56 maximum speed into perspective, he is faster than 
four-fifths of the starting running backs.


                               Running Backs

Feature Backs
Note-In running backs, the most important asset is maximum speed.  All 
the other stats are not nearly as important.  With this in mind, I 
ranked the running backs by maximum speed, with total points as a 
tiebreaker.  I felt that total points was not an accurate 
representation of how good a back was.  Total points gave an advantage
to fullbacks.  I think most readers of this guide will agree that Bo 
Jackson is a better feature back than Tony Paige, even though Paige
has a 13 point advantage in total points.

Fullbacks
However, just to be fair to the fullbacks like Paige, I also created 
a category for fullbacks.  In order to qualify for this category, a 
minimum of 69 hitting power is needed.  I found the fullback points by 
using the following equation:  2MS+2HP+RC=Fullback points

Facts Worth Noting

Indianapolis, Miami, New England, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Seattle, 
Philadelphia, Dallas, Chicago, Green Bay, Tampa Bay, San Francisco, the 
Rams, and New Orleans all have starters that are slower than one of 
their backups.  However, half of these slow starters are fullbacks.  

The Bills have both of the worst two running backs in the league,so if 
Thomas gets injured, the running attack is severely crippled.

San Diego has Rod Bernstine listed at running back, but he starts at 
wide receiver.  His stats are more like a running back's, but his 
number is 82, a wideout's number.

Lions' backup Willie Green is listed as a running back, but his 
statistics and his jersey number (86) lead me to believe that he is a 
wide receiver and Tecmo wanted to make sure that every team had four 
backs on it.  He is the only running back with 13 hitting power.  All
the rest of the RBs have at least 19.  Just about all wide receivers,
however, have only 13.

Christian Okoye is the only position player to have anything other than 
69 rushing power.  He has 75.

Almost all backs have 50 ball control and 38 running speed.

Even though Bo Jackson is the best pure runner, he is tied for the 
worst receiver out of the backfield.

                             Wide Receivers

Wide Receiver Points
The equation for WR points is as follows.
MS+RC=WRP
If there was a tie between two or more receivers, I used total points 
as a tiebreaker.

Facts Worth Noting

Art Monk for Washington and Gary Wilkins for Atlanta are the only WRs 
with anything other than 13 hitting power.  Monk has 38 points, and 
Wilkins has 31.  Wilkins is actually a tight end, which explains his 
higher hitting power.

Every receiver has 69 rushing power and 13 hitting power, and most have 
50 ball control.

Good ball control seems to depend on the team.  There are 20 WRs that 
have more than 50 ball control, but these 20 are spread throughout only 
7 teams.  Houston has six, and Pittsburgh and Washington both have four 
apiece.

Every team has four wide receivers except Houston, Detroit, and 
Atlanta.  These teams run a run and shoot offense, so they don't use 
tight ends.  They substitute wideouts for the two tight end positions.
They also substitute a starting WR in a starting running back's 
position, but a backup WR position is filled by a running back as well.

The NFC has 6 of the top nine WRs.

Pittsburgh, Kansas City, and Seattle are the only teams with 
backup wide receivers that are better than their starters.

Facts Worth Noting

Every TE has 25 running speed except for Clarence Kay for Denver.  I'd 
just like to know:  Why Clarence Kay?  He's not real good.  He's only 
an average starting tight end.  

Every TE has 69 rushing power.

Facts Worth Noting

All OLs have 25 running speed and 69 rushing power except for Denver 
guard Doug Widell, whose numbers are nearly the inverse.  He has 69 
running speed and 31 rushing power.  I can't see any difference, even 
after watching him closely in a preseason game.

Guards as a whole tend to have high maximum speed and low hitting 
power, tackles have low MS and high HP, and centers are moderate in 
both categories.  This makes sense, because guards do a lot of pulling, 
while tackles specialize in pass blocking.

13 of the worst 16 linemen are in the NFC.

Facts Worth Noting

All kickers have 56 running speed, 81 rushing power, 81 maximum speed, 
and 31 hitting power.  If you know your stats at all, you'll realize 
that these values are abnormally high.  I bet that this was done 
because every other player seems to get faster on kick returns.  You 
never really notice how fast your kicker is until you recover a blocked 
field goal.  Then you realize just how fast he is.  It's not completely 
unheard of to score a TD after recovering a block.

Kickers really run the gamut in both the other categories.  Kickers 
have anywhere between 81 and 19 kicking ability and 81 and 25 avoid 
kick block.

Facts worth noting

Punters all have 25 running speed, 56 rushing power, 44 maximum speed, 
and 31 hitting power.  44 is a decent amount of maximum speed, but it 
seems extremely slow when covering punts.  The only time your punter 
makes the tackle on a punt is when the returner manages to get by the 
first wave of potential tacklers.  The computer never seems to have a 
slow punter,though, as the COM punter is usually one of the first 
people down to tackle the returner.

You're probably wondering why punters have an avoid kick block value.  
To tell you the truth, I'm not completely sure.  Punters hardly ever 
get a punt rush, since a player doesn't control anybody until the punt 
returner gets the ball.  I've only seen two people get a punt rush:  
Derrick Thomas and Lawrence Taylor.  This isn't a coincidence.  These 
two are the fastest linebackers in the game.  Occasionally when one of 
two are in excellent condition, they will tackle the punter.  
There are also a VERY, VERY rare times when the punt acts like it got 
blocked.  This is so rare that I have only heard about it, never seen 
it myself.  As I understand it, the punter gets hit just as he kicks 
the ball, after the punting cutscene.  The punt acts the same way as a 
blocked field goal.  It's anybody's guess as to whether it is 
intentional or just a glitch.  I am of the opinion that it is 
intentional.  I think that originally Tecmo was planning to let the 
player rush the punt, but ran out of time to program it in, or 
encountered problems in the testing stage after trying to put it in.  
(As a side note, you can punt rush on later versions of Tecmo on SNES 
and Genesis.)  Rather than try to fix it, they probably just decided 
not to put it in.  The block is just something they never took out 
because it never came up during testing.

Facts Worth Noting

Bruce Smith is so dominant that he leads defensive linemen in four 
separate categories.  He isn't even tied in these four categories.  The 
two he doesn't lead are the two least important, since pass 
interceptions are rarely a factor on the line, and rushing power has 
little discernable effect.

Bob Nelson, the Green Bay nosetackle, is one of those Tecmo legends.  
He's somebody that virtually nobody has heard of but excels on TSB.  
His stats are a little strange as well.  While most linemen's stats are 
greatest at HP or QC, Nelson's are greatest at RP.  No other lineman 
has his greatest value at RP.

Facts Worth Noting

If you see a linebacker on Tecmo who you thought was a defensive 
lineman, you're probably right.  Every team has a 3-4 (3 linemen, 4 
linebackers) defensive formation on TSB, but in real life, many pro 
teams start four linemen and and only three linebackers.  In order to 
make every team have four linebackers on Tecmo, many teams had a 
linemen moved to linebacker.  One big benefactor of this move is the 
Philadelphia Eagles.  All you Jerome Brown fans can thank Tecmo for 
moving him from defensive tackle to TILB.  To make things even 
stranger, Cleveland even has a corner, Tony Blaylock, at LB.  A few 
others that I know of are Dennis Byrd (Jets), Ray Childress (Oilers), 
Scott Davis (Raiders), Leslie O.Neal (Chargers), Cortez Kennedy 
(Seahawks), Tracy Rocker (Redskins), Jimmie Jones (Cowboys), Keith 
Millard (Vikings), and Kevin Greene (Rams).

Even though you probably think of the NFC central as the black and blue 
division with strong defenses year after year, eight of the worst nine 
LBs hail from that division.  However, the NFC central also has the 
third and fourth best as well.

Facts Worth Noting

Pheonix safety Lonnie Young has an astounding 69 running speed.  Every 
other defensive back has between 25 and 44 running speed.

Safeties tend to have better hitting power than corners.

Nine of the twelve worst defensive backs are corners.

The safeties in Tecmo are divided into two categories.  The top 
safeties are free safeties, the bottom are strong safeties.  In real
football, the strong safeties cover people like tight ends or third 
wide receivers on man coverages.  Free safeties will help with 
receivers that go deep.  I can't tell any difference on Tecmo, either 
in coverage or any other behavior.

The best five safeties in the league are free safeties.

Simply, this is where the schedule for all 17 weeks is listed.  If you 
are looking for team-by-team schedules, they are in the scouting 
reports section.

The games in each week will not necessarily follow this order.  The 
game rearranges the schedule each week when that week arrives.  The 
rearranging seems to follow no discernible order.  These games are 
listed in the default order, which is in order by the first team.

CAUTION!
Extremely long, boring, and confusing explanation ahead!  If you are 
bored easily or care nothing about why some schedules are designed the 
way they are, skip to the next section and save yourself a few minutes.

There are a few oddities which exist in the schedule because of the 
divisions.  Since four divisions have five teams and the two other 
divisions have only four teams, the schedule can get very convoluted.  

First of all, every team plays every other team in its division twice.  
Every team has a sixteen game schedule with one bye week in the middle 
of the season.  Every team plays games against four teams in a single 
division from the other conference.  If the other division has five 
teams, the team plays the four teams that have the regular schedule 
(see below).

Most of the teams in the divisions with five teams have the basic 
schedule.  The exceptions are New England, Denver, Pheonix, and 
Minnesota.  The basic teams (I'll call them Type I teams) play every 
team in their division twice, which accounts for eight games.  They 
also play two teams from each other division in their conference, which 
accounts for four more games.  The last four games are played against 
four teams in a single division from the other conference.

The teams in the divisions with four teams (Type II teams) have six 
divisional games and three games against the other two divisions in 
their conference.  They also play four teams against four teams in a 
single division in the other conference.

The odd teams out, the Type III teams, play the other four teams in 
their respective divisions twice.  In addition, they play the other 
Type III team in their confence twice.  They play the remaining two 
Type III teams once each.  The last four games are played against the 
division in their conference with only four teams.

                            Scouting Reports
#######################################################################

In this section I will go over each of the 28 teams in Tecmo in order 
of how they appear on the team data screen, plus the two Pro Bowl 
teams.  Rankings, rosters, schedules, and analyses are included for 
each team.

Each player is also covered, followed by their percentile at their 
position in the league.  The percentile is computed by taking a the 
number of players at that position minus the player's rank at their 
position, then taking that number and dividing it by the total number 
of players at that position.  Then multiply this by 100 to get a 
percentile.  For example, let's take Dan Marino, who is ranked fifth 
at quarterback.  Take the number of people at quarterback (56) and 
subtract Dan's rank (5) from it.  This gives us 51.  Divide this by 
the number of quarterbacks (51/56=.91).  Multiply this by 100 and- 
Voila!- you have a players percentile.

I also figured out the strength of each team's offense and defense 
using these percentiles.  I ranked each team separately for a MAN 
controller and a COM controller.  The computer controlls teams so much 
differently than a player does that I thought this was warranted.  For 
each team's COM rating, I took all the starters besides offensive 
linemen and added their percentiles together.  Then, I added five times 
the average of the offensive linemen and backups.  I then added the 
average of the kicker and punter to find the final overall value.  I 
did this because it gives the offense and defense equal value.

The man value for offense can be found by taking the highest percentile 
among a team's running backs and adding it to the better QB and the 
best reciever (WR or TE).  The defensive man rating is figured the same 
way, except with the best lineman, linebacker, and defensive back.

Strength of schedule is found by ranking the schedule based on the sum 
of the subjective rankings of a team's opponents.  The rankings are 1 
to 28 where 28 is the easiest and 1 is the hardest.

The Bills are the most balanced team on the game.  They've got 
excellent players at every position.  Buffalo has five Pro Bowlers, the 
most of any team.  The weak schedule is the icing on the cake.  All in 
all, the Bills are the most powerful team in the AFC.

On offense, this team is such a chameleon that you could put in almost 
any system and it would work.  Thomas is one of the best running backs 
in the league, and it helps that he has an incredible line to run 
behind, not to mention FB Mueller.  QB Bills has an excellent recieving 
corps.  Even Thomas can catch out of the backfield if needed.  The 
spots to watch are depth, especially at RB.  If Thomas goes down, 
you'll be forced to run a smash-mouth running game with Mueller, who is 
tied for the slowest back on the game.  Also Reich is not a very good 
backup, so protect QB Bills by running out of bounds if you must.  If 
one of these two offensive cogs goes down, compensate with the other.  
If both go down, you're in trouble.

On defense, this team has a couple stars, backed up by a solid unit.  
Bruce Smith is head and shoulders above any competition at the 
defensive line, and he can take over a game single-handedly if he 
becomes posessed.  Buffalo has an excellent linebacking core, including 
OLB C.Bennett, who is the quicker picker upper for any mess Smith can't 
handle.  The secondary is the only question mark, because it has no 
stars.  To call it a weakness is insulting, because they have a decent 
unit.  The only time it should come into play is if you must cover the 
pass, but that shouldn't be a problem if you pick a pass.

Strength-23

The Dolts are one of the worst teams in the game without question.  
With a hideous defense and no strengths on offense, many Tecmoers rank 
these guys below even the lowly Patriots.

The offense rides on the "back" of Bentley (pun intended), and the two 
starting WRs.  These guys are really nothing special, they just are 
better than the rest of this pretty bad offense.  The one strong point 
of this offense is a pretty good playbook.  This default one can get 
pretty tough to stop with a lineman or linebacker.

This defense is absolutely abominable.  To put this in perspective, 
only DE Clancy is above average, and even then only by a hair.  An 
awful secondary makes defending against the pass nearly impossible.  
All you can do with this defense is pray that the other team has mercy, 
because you won't be able to do anything to stop them.  

One of the great mysteries of Tecmo is why the developers chose to 
leave Eric Dickerson out of this game.  He was not retired yet.  The 
best explanation is that Tecmo couldn't use his name.  If this were 
the case, common sense would dictate that they would still use "RB 
Colts" like they did with Jim Kelly, Bernie Kosar, and Randall 
Cunningham.  Dickerson even appears in both Tecmo Bowl for NES and TSB 
I for SNES and Genesis, so why did they leave him out in this version?

Miami is one of my least favorite teams, because it doesn't seem to be 
able to form a real feeling in the way it runs.  The defense is a solid 
but unspectacular unit lacking flavor, and the offense seems to want to 
pass but lacks the superb reciever to make a truly great passing 
offense.

The offense of Miami is anchored by the best offensive line in the NFL.  
QB Dan Marino is one of the best QBs in the league, and 81 passing 
speed gives him a tie for the fastest passer in the league.  He does 
well, but he would do much better if he had a better supporting cast.  
The running game is dependent on the strong line and Paige's running 
and blocking.  However, both backs are just a little too slow to be 
anything other than changes of pace and occasional receivers out of the 
backfield.  I've always thought that Miami suffers because of a bad 
playbook for its style.  A run and shoot or shotgun based offense is 
more tailored to Miami's strengths than the current T-formation system 
that runs sweeps and dives.  Try putting backup TE Jensen in as a 
fourth receiver.  He's got great hands and is wasted as a backup to 
pro-bowler Edmunds.

The defense is pretty much a wash, and, like the offense, suffers from 
lack of a star.  Cross and Offerdahl anchor the front seven, which 
gives way to decent corners and two very good safeties.  All-in-all, a 
great team against the pass and tough enough against the run.

The Patriots blow.  I can't put it any more clearly.  There's really 
nothing much else to say.

The Patriots are absolutely horrible on offense.  They have, without a 
doubt, the worst offense on the game, and probably even in all of 
recorded Tecmo history.  Steve "Please intercept my horrible passes" 
Grogan should inquire about a job at NASA, because he seems to be able 
to launch footballs into the upper atmosphere.  Marc Wilson is a hair 
better, but still a long way from All-Pro.  The receivers are pretty 
bad, though TE Cook can be a weapon if not covered.  The running game 
isn't going to help, because an awful back running behind a worse line 
adds up to "Let's depend on the passing game," which I've covered 
already.  

The defense is not as bad as the offense, but don't get the impression 
that it's good. DE Ray Agnew and CB Ronnie Lippett are the lone bright 
spots in an otherwise lackluster unit.  Run defense can really be a 
problem, because the Pats' front seven is made up of weaklings after 
Agnew and LB Tippett.

The Jets are a team that I like quite a bit, but they are not one of 
the league's premier teams.  They get by, but mostly because of three 
stars on defense and controlling the ball on offense.  The weak 
schedule is helpful too.

The offense revolves around Blair Thomas, a good-but-not-great running 
back.  Make sure you take the inept fullback McNeil out and replace him 
with Hector.  Together, Thomas and Hector can make for a good one-two 
punch.  If one is in bad condition, use the other.  The passing game is 
not the greatest, but it can unfold if you use it strictly as a change 
of pace.  After lulling the opponent into a run rhythm, spring the 
playaction pass for big yards.  If you are forced to run a regular 
pass, throw it short, because O.Brien's arm is nothing special.

The defense depends on big plays from ILBs Byrd and Clifton and S 
McMillan.  If the offense takes these three out of the picture, it's 
lights out, because the Jets are pathetically weak everywhere else.  In 
fact, only two other players on defense have percentiles above 20.

Cincinnati is a good team that's often forgotten because it stands in 
the looming shadow that the Oilers throw over the AFC Central.  With an 
offense that can take over games, and possibly the best defender on 
TSB, Cincinnati can be a thorn in the side of even an excellent team.  
Of course, it has plenty of chances, because its schedule is the second 
toughest in the league, with two games against division rival Houston, 
as well as a game apiece against the Bills, Giants, and Raiders.

The offense is pretty good.  If this unit was supported by a dominating 
defense, Cincinnati could be one of the best teams in the game.  The 
one weak link is the two wide recievers.  Depth is excellent, 
especially at QB and RB.  Cincinnati's default playbook is not the best 
fit for the Bengals, simply because it doesn't allow Pro Bowl TE Holman 
to get the receptions he deserves.  When putting in a new playbook, 
make sure that Holman goes out on more routes.  Emphasize the tight 
end, and deemphasize the WRs.

The defense's heart and soul is found in David Fulcher, who is simply 
amazing.  Once you get past him, things go sharply downhill.  The 
defensive line is horrendous, and the linebackers, with the exception 
of Francis, aren't much better.  The corners are second and third to 
worst among defensive backs.  The safeties, of course, hold this 
otherwise weak defense together.

Strength-4 (tied)

There really is no way to get around saying this:  Cleveland is a very 
weak team.  With plenty of weaknesses and no big strengths, they are 
the laughingstock of the AFC Central.

The offense depends on the Kosar to Slaughter connection, with the 
running game fueled by switching up Mack and Metcalf, two backs with 
very different styles.  Depth on this unit is awful with the exception 
of solid backup QB Mike Pagel.  Even most of the starters are below the 
average for starters.

The defense isn't a whole lot better.  LB Mike Johnson is the lone 
impact player on this defense, but even he's not very good.  Tony 
Blaylock and Frank Minnifield are the only other solid players on this 
unit.  After these three, the defense is one big weakness.

Tony Blaylock is actually a third corner, though the game lists him as 
an OLB.  This explains the number and somewhat strange stats.  Regular 
starting CB Frank Minnifield had held out for the first four games of 
'90 and ended up playing in only nine games, so the game decided to put 
Blaylock in as well, because he got almost as much playing time as 
Minnifield.

Strength-8

Houston is an excellent team whose strength lies mainly in its 
incredible passing game.  With a solid running game and a decent 
defense to back up the pass, Houston is a playoff regular.

The passing game of Houston is the best in the NFL, and the aerial 
combination of Moon to Hill is beaten only by San Francisco's Montana 
to Rice.  The other three receivers are almost as good as Hill.  The 
above average line is anchored by its pair of stellar guards.  The 
depth is some of the best to be found in the league.  The running game 
is good enough to get by.  One caution:  White has the worst ball 
control in the entire game.  This means a lot of fumbles, but it can be 
compensated for by running out of bounds if faced with a sure tackle.  
Otherwise, you can opt for the superior ball control of any one of the 
backups (they're all the same) at the cost of receptions, maximum 
speed, and hitting power.

The defense's job is to hold its opponents to few enough points that 
the high-octane offense can outscore them.  A solid line makes up for a 
weak linebacking squad, though Childress is quite good.  CB Richard 
Johnson is good enough that offenses have to throw away from him.  All-
in-all, the defense is good enough to contain the opposition, but not 
good enough to dominate it.

Strength-10

Pittsburgh gets by on its Steel Curtain defense and a bruising, ball 
control offense.

The offense is all about long, time-consuming drives.  Every position 
player on the offense has an astounding 81 ball control, which means 
that you can fight for every yard with little concern for the 
possibility of a fumble.  The line is the only other strength on this 
team.  The passing game stinks to high heaven and survives on short 
passes over the middle to TE Eric Green.  Make sure you replace inept 
Derek Hill with the speedier Dwight Stone.  When running with Hoge and 
Williams, make sure you run horizontally and not vertically.  They 
aren't fast enough to get out of most jams and every yard is precious 
in this talent-starved offense.

The defense is without peer.  The only "weakness" that can be found is 
in the bottom linebackers, who have "only" 61 percentiles.  Rod Woodson 
is a dominating corner and LB Greg Lloyd strikes fear into backs 
throughout the league.  Everybody on this defense will cause problems 
for the opposition.  Don't even dream about running on them, because 
they will swarm even the fastest back immediately.  The only way to 
beat them is to take quick, short outlet passes to open TEs and RBs.  
Throwing into coverage is suicidal, because all the defensive backs can 
pick off an errant pass on a bad day and cause a fumble on a good one.

Pittsburgh is one of the best returning teams.  The question "Why?" 
puzzles even the most avid Tecmo expert.  Only one thing is known, and 
that is that Pittsburgh and New Orleans are the two best return team in 
the league, with the Raiders and Bears close behind.

Denver is another of my favorite teams, though there's little rational 
reason for this.  They are misused by the computer, which means that 
they are overlooked by many Tecmophiles.

Humphries is a better back than anyone gives him credit for.  One of 
the problems is that he doesn't have a bruising fullback to clear the 
way for him.  The other three running backs are bumbling morons who 
can't outrun Elway, so don't even try to involve any of them in the 
ground game.  WRs Johnson and Jackson (not to be confused with 
corporate medical giant Johnson & Johnson) along with TE Kay are 
capable receivers, though they aren't superstars.

The defense is dependent on its linebackers and safeties to hold up an 
otherwise weak squad.  The line is one of the worst in the league.  
Fletcher is the speedy linebacker who provides the pass rush, while the 
slower but stronger duo of Mecklenburg and Brooks provide the run 
support.  The corners are just plain bad, but the safeties are a crutch 
for them to lean on.

Kansas City is a powerful team that can give the powerful Raiders a run 
for their money for the divisional crown.  They have a great defense 
and a running game that pounds the opponent into submission.

Okoye is an astounding back.  For many Tecmoers, he beats out the 
faster Bo Jackson, just because he can make popcorn.  Barry Word also 
can make popcorn, though he doesn't have the combination of speed and 
power that makes Okoye such a force of nature.  Their one weakness is 
in their passing game.  De Berg is good, but he only has one good 
reciever to throw to in Paige.  The short passing game suffers 
especially.  TE Roberts would not be a starter on most other teams, and 
Okoye and Word are tied for two of the worst catching backs in the 
league.  This can be remedied by taking out word for McNair, who can 
catch better and run faster, but then Word's hitting power must be 
sacrificed.  Also, WR Robb Thomas' one increment better receptions is 
not worth his horrible speed.  Put in Birden, who can run much faster.

The defense is better than solid, especially with the playmaking skills 
of OLB Derrick Thomas.  The line is anchored by end Neil Smith, even 
though less talented NT Saleaumua is the Pro Bowler.  LB Thomas is the 
second best linebacker in the game, so the rest of the LBs tend to get 
overshadowed.  In reality, they are the best linbacking squad in the 
conference.  The secondary is dependent on the two above average 
corners to cover for the less-than-stellar safeties.

The Raiders are the proud owners of the best pair of running backs in 
the league, and also the best defensive line.  Together, these two 
factors make them a team to be feared.

The offense is better all-around than many Tecmo players give it credit 
for.  The running game tends to overshadow the passing game.  Bo 
Jackson is the best back in the league alone, but when combined with 
his running mate Marcus Allen, the Raiders running game is unstoppable.  
Schroeder is an average starting QB who is lucky enough to throw to a 
superb group of WRs.  Fernandez and Gault are two receivers who more 
than get the job done, and backup Tim Brown could start on most teams.  
Graddy has more speed than he knows what to do with, but can't catch at 
all.  Still, put him in at returner and he'll tear up the field.

The line is the cornerstone of the defense.  It seems one of them will 
be possessed nearly every game.  This line is easily the best in the 
game.  Unfortunately, the LBs are the achilles heel in this defense.  
None of them are awful, its just that all but Scott Davis (ironically, 
a DT in real life) are below average.  Most of them are better at 
intercepting passes than at defending the run or rushing the passer.  
The secondary is quite good, with S Anderson as its heart.

The San Diego Chargers are better than they seem.  Unfortunately, they 
are only the fourth best team in their division, so they tend to get 
overlooked.

The offense is a bit warped.  This team has no business with the system 
that they have in.  First of all, Rod Bernstine is listed as a running 
back but lines up as a wide receiver.  He never touches the ball in the 
ground game unless the plays are changed.  On top of that, he really 
can't play either position well.  Do yourself a favor and put Harmon in 
his spot, no matter how you use him.  Backup WR Walker is better than 
Early, so make that substitution at the beginning of the year.  Even 
with these substitutions, this offense should not run a one-back 
system.  Tolliver isn't a good enough quarterback to feature in a pass 
oriented offense.  Excepting Anthony Miller, the receivers are all 
pretty shoddy.  The offense should rely on RB Butts to gain the yards 
needed.  Try a two back system more like the Bills' for better results.  
With a surprisingly good O-line, Butts should be able to run his way to 
daylight.

The defense is better than solid.  The line is able to hold its own, 
and the linebackers have the run stuffing skills of Plummer with the 
pass rushing skills of O.Neal and the coverage skills of Rolling.  CB 
Byrd is the spice in an otherwise vanilla secondary.

Strength-4 (tied)

Bad offense plus bad defense equals bad team, a theory reinforced by 
the Seattle Seahawks.  A tough schedule and a bad team make for a 
lethal combination that most Tecmoers are wise to stay away from.

The offense coulde be better if it better utilized its players.  
Neither Williams nor Fenner deserve to be a featured running back.  My 
advice is to put either James "Earl" Jones or Chris Warren in as the 
halfback, and keep Fenner as the fullback.  However, don't waste 
Williams' awesome receptions by keeping him out.  Replace TE Heller 
with him.  Williams is only one increment worse in hitting power, and 
he's better in running speed, maximum speed, and receptions.  The 
backfield is still bad, but at least it can get a few more yards.  
Krieg is a good starting quarterback, but he lacks anybody to catch his 
passes.  Even with the addition of Williams, the receiving corps is 
awful.

The defense's only strength is found in Jacob Green.  With him, the 
line is a little better than average.  The linebackers, led by Porter, 
are horrible.  The secondary is pretty awful, with even the best 
defensive back only average in terms of the league.

Washington is my least favorite team.  The computer always seems to do 
well with them, but my experiences are disappointments, without 
exception.  There are no superstars to carry the load on this team.

The offense is not that good, but at least the system fits superbly.  
QB Rypien is a horrible passer.  It's a shame that wide receivers the 
caliber of these are wasted on a quarterback like him.  Byner is good, 
and the Redskins could even run a two-back system if they wanted to, 
with Riggs as the fullback or Bryant as another speed back.  If you 
keep a system with a tight end, take Warren out and replace him with 
Johnson.  The line is good and depth is excellent.  Every time I see 
the Redskins' offense, I look at Rypien and think of what could have 
been.

The defense is very weak.  It doesn't have a star to anchor it.  Nobody 
is better than the 80th percentile.  Mann heads an otherwise weak line, 
and the linebackers are average.  You can run fairly well on the 
Redskins.  The defense's strength is found in the cornerbacks.  Green 
is very fast, but can't intercept much.  Mayhew is the more balanced 
corner.  The safeties are pathetic losers who can be wiped up with a 
damp rag.

Ah, the Giants.  One of the powerhouses of the league, and some would 
argue the best team around.  They have a good offense, and an excellent 
defense, especially with LB Lawrence Taylor.

The offense is anchored by its two running backs.  Anderson is one of 
an elite class of running backs that are both fast and can make 
popcorn.  Meggett runs a fine counterpoint, as he is a bit speedier and 
can double as a receiver out of the backfield.  The passing game is 
better than adequate, although it would be better with a great wide 
receiver.  Bavaro is a great blocking tight end, and his catching is 
good enough to get by.  The weak link in this offense is the depth at 
quarterback and at running back.  QB Hostetler is awful, and though 
Hampton is a decent back, almost anything will fell like a drop-off 
after Meggett and Anderson.  Backup RB Carthon is just plain bad.

The Giants' defense is good all around.  The line is a bit below 
average, but not much.  The linebackers are incredible.  Hands down, 
they have the best set in the league.  Taylor and Johnson are demons 
that can take over games, and Reasons can pick off almost any pass 
thrown over the middle.  It's really sickening.  Many a time I've been 
playing the Giants and I have seen a wide open tight end in the middle 
of the field.  I throw it and... Reasons jumps about 20 feet in the air 
and intercepts what I thought would be a sure seven yard gain.  The 
secondary has four very solid cover guys, though none of them really 
stand out.

Philly is my favorite team, so excuse me if I gush a bit.  QB Eagles 
cannot be stopped, and the front seven of the defense is excellent.  
This makes for an excellent team.

Philadelphia's offense IS QB Eagles, known in real life as Randall 
Cunningham.  He can pass very well, and he can run the ball just as 
well.  The problem is that he's easy to misuse if you use him like a 
regular quarterback.  Don't retreat at all if you can help it.  
Instead, run to the outside near the line of scrimmage.  Don't spend 
all day looking for open receivers.  If you have open field in front of 
you, take off.  Make sure you run out of bounds before getting tackled, 
because backup Jim McMahon is terrible, and an injury limits this 
offense's ability to function until QB Eagles comes back.  This 
offense's playbook can be a lot better.  Instead of the innefectual 
two-back system that is the default, put in a run and shoot system.  
This will spread the field and allow QB Eagles to run better.  Put 
Sherman in as the featured back, and put Byars in as the second running 
back, which will become a wide receiver position.  TE Jackson is the 
man to look for, as he is an excellent receiver.

The front seven is the strength of this defense.  DEs White and Simmons 
are incredible, and they are backed up by linebackers led by Jerome 
Brown and Seth Joyner.  Running on these guys can be suicidal, and 
you'll want to smash your controller after Reggie White gets after your 
passer for the 58th straight time.  However, if you can avoid the rush, 
the secondary is easy to pick apart.  The corners are good, but the 
safeties are awful.  At least Hopkins can  hit and intercept the ball 
once in a while, unlike Waters, who can't do anything.  CB Allen is 
good, but he's more than canceled out by the super-weak Andre Waters.

Yes, at one time they were called the Phoenix Cardinals, and no, they 
weren't very good then either.  The 1991 version features the running 
of Johnny Johnson and the sheer crappiness of 29 other carbon-based 
life forms.  The toughest schedule in the league doesn't help either.

The offense relies on RB Johnson.  After that, things go sharply 
downhill.  QB Rosenbach should be replaced with Tupa, which means that 
you have a future punter at the helm.  (Trust me, I'm not making this 
up.  Tupa did become a punter soon after failing in the NFL as a 
quarterback.)  The receivers are horrible, and three of them doesn't 
make any difference in how well the passing game does.  Depth isn't 
bad, but don't expect the backups to galvanize the offense into a 
juggernaut.

The defense is pretty awful.  DE Freddie Joe Nunn and LB Ken Harvey are 
the only things that keep this front seven away from complete 
ineptitude.  The corners are bad, but the safeties are very good, even 
if one of them is very warped in terms of statistics.  FS Young has 69 
running speed, a feat that is unequaled by any other player except 
Denver G Doug Widell.  "Why?" is a mystery.

Dallas suffers from being a mediocre team in an excellent division.  It 
shows flashes of how it matured into a squad that won three out of four 
Super Bowls, but it hadn't jelled enough yet in 1991.

The offense is average.  There isn't a whole lot to say.  RB Emmitt 
Smith is good, TE Jay Novacek is good, FB Tommie Agee is bad.  Pretty 
much everything else is a wash.  Take out Agee and replace him with 
Highsmith, who is much faster, but can't block quite as well.

The defense is a strong unit, but it doesn't have the superstar 
required to bump it to the next level.  DE Stubbs is good, and everyone 
else in the front seven is solid but not worth mentioning.  The corners 
are a very good pair, and with strong safeties to back them up, they 
can cover any receiving corps that they are put up against.

'Da Bears' are another one of those teams that relies on ball control 
offense and a demonic defense to play grind-it-out games with scores 
like 14-6.  They do this well enough to make them far and away the best 
team in their otherwise weak division.

The offense is very one-dimensional.  Anderson is a great back, and he 
runs behind punishing fullback Brad Muster.  Even if Anderson gets 
injured, Johnny Bailey can step in and still the offense will lose 
little.  The middle of the offensive line will clear holes wide enough 
for a truck to drive through, so dives and other inside runs are a good 
idea.  The passing game is bad beyond belief.  Harbaugh is one of the 
worst starting QBs in the game, and backup Tomczak doesn't provide any 
relief.  Both wide receivers just plain suck compared to most starters, 
and the tight end specializes in blocking.  If you absolutely must 
pass, go to Muster or Anderson in the flat.  They both are better than 
the receivers at catching.  One option that will open up the passing 
game a lot at the cost of the running game is to put Anderson as a wide 
receiver and put Bailey in as starting running back.  Anderson can't 
catch as well as many wide receivers, but he's either better or the 
same as the Bears' awful wideouts in every category.  I still wouldn't 
recommend this unless you absolutely need a passing game.  Another way 
to structure this offense is to put Bailey and Anderson in as starting 
backs, and move Muster out to tight end.  Muster can catch, plus you 
can get him into the secondary, where he can make popcorn much easier.

The defense has extraordinary players everywhere you look.  The line 
has two pass-rushers in DEs Dent and Armstrong, and a solid run-stopper 
with William "the refridgerator" Perry.  Singletary makes up for an 
otherwise blah linebacking squad.  FS Carrier and two great 
cornerbacks limit passes to short stuff over the middle.  This is a 
TOUGH defense to do much against.  The best way to do anything is to 
wait for Harbaugh to make a mistake and then capitalize on it.

It takes only two words to describe this team:  Barry Sanders.  As with 
most of the 90s, Barry was the team this year, with everybody else just 
trying to get him the ball.

The offense is ill-designed.  It was called the Silver Stretch offense, 
because it tried to subsist on long passes.  As you can see, they 
didn't really have the receivers to run a good run-and-shoot attack.  
Peete is a good running quarterback, so I'd suggest keeping him in over 
Andre Ware, whose best strength is (Yippee!) avoid pass block.  (Can 
you feel the sarcasm?)  Make sure you aren't afraid to run with Peete.  
For instructions, see my comments on Philadelphia.  The problem with 
these guys is trying to utilize their weapons without creating glaring 
weaknesses.  My suggestion is not to let backup running back Mel Gray 
languish on the bench.  If you like to pass, keep a run and shoot 
system in, but replace the pathetic WR Aubrey Matthews with Gray.  Gray 
is actually better in nearly every aspect, especially speed.  Even with 
this addition, your passing game will still be weak.  If you like to 
run more, put a two back system in with Sanders and Gray as two very 
quick backs.  The problem is who to put in at tight end.  My best 
suggestion is RB James Wilder, who makes a pretty lame tight end, but 
at least he can block better than anyone else on the squad.

The defense is pretty icky.  It has a few good players, but it also has 
quite a few players that shouldn't be in the NFL.  Ball, Cofer, 
Spielman, and Owens are the only pillars that support a front seven 
that can crumble at any time.  White is the defensive back worth 
mentioning, as all the rest can't do a whole lot.

Green Bay revolves around two players:  on offense, WR Sterling Sharpe, 
and on defense, the anonymous Bob Nelson.  Other than that, the Packers 
blow pretty bad on both sides of the ball.

The offense holds its own, but not easily.  The backfield is average, 
as is QB Majkowski.  Sharpe is a Pro Bowler, but nobody else catches 
well on this team.  The offensive line is a little weak, but the 
Packers counter that effect by having some of the best general depth in 
the league.

NT Bob Nelson and OLB Tim Harris are the only glimmering points in this 
dismal defense.  Offenses can have their way with the Green Bay D, 
because other than these two, every player is below average, and more 
than half are horrible.

Minnesota, my hometown team,  traditionally duels it out with the Lions 
and Packers for second place in the division on Tecmo.  It relies on 
its tough defense to force opponents to make mistakes.  Once it does, 
the offense capitalizes with a few choice weapons.

Minnesota's offense is not spectacular, but it gets the job done.  The 
good offensive line is the foundation of the offense, providing Wilson 
with time to pass and Walker with holes to run through.  Wilson is not 
the greatest, but he throws to WR Anthony Carter and TE Jordan, both of 
whom are great receivers.  The other wideout, Jones, is adequate, and 
Chris Carter can fill in admirably.  RB Walker could be a lot better, 
especially considering that Minnesota traded away half a team for him.  
That said, he manages to get the job done.

The defense is one of the stronger ones in the league.  DE Doleman 
teams up with two other linemen who are hardly slouches to form a good 
line.  The top two linebackers are superb, though the bottom two are 
awful.  The secondary is anchored by two, count-em, TWO Pro Bowlers.  
That means that they make up half the NFC Pro Bowl secondary.  CB 
Rutland and FS Fullington are adequate.

Back in the day, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were the perennial 
laughingstock of the league.  This was before the logo change and 
subsequent regaining of pride that came with a dominating defense.  
Yes, back then you could count a game against the Buccaneers as a sure 
win.  Okay, enough with the history lesson.  Its all true, though less 
so in TSB.  The defense is awful, and the offense is not a whole lot 
better.  But at least they have a good kicker!  (Sarcasm, again.)

The offense is dependent on the ground game.  (Yes, that probably is 
the 15th time I've said that, especially in this division.)  RB 
Anderson follows FB Cobb through the lack of a whole that the horrible 
offensive line provides.  QB Testaverde is a gritty scrambler, and if 
you're up on your football jargon, you know that gritty is a nice way 
to say "not very talented."  For receivers, RBs Cobb and Anderson in 
the flat are good choices, and WR Carrier can hold his own.  After 
that, it's slim pickings.  If you want more speed, backup WR Drewry is 
a little faster than starter Hill, but can't catch quite as well.

The defense ebbs and flows with CB Wayne Haddix, who is not to be 
confused with Green Bay fullback Michael Haddix.  Both are excellent at 
their jobs, and both are in the NFC Central, but this one is the 
obvious captain of his unit.  After Haddix, this defense is a morass of 
defenders writhing in a general direction toward the ball.  Simply put, 
this defense blows.

San Francisco is an excellent team.  Lucky for them, Tecmo fell right 
in the middle of their 15 year dynasty.  In my opinion, they are the 
best team in the game.  If you've ever played them in the playoffs, you 
know exactly what I'm talking about.

San Francisco's offense is immortalized by one phrase:  "Montana to 
Rice."  Montana is tied for the best pure thrower in the game, and Rice 
is clearly the best wide receiver.  Craig is a better than adequate 
running back who gets overshadowed by the passing game.  FB Rathman 
opens the holes for him.  Both Rathman and Craig can be used as good 
receivers out of the backfield.  WR Taylor and TE Jones are both 
excellent players at their position.  All these guys guarantee that San 
Francisco will never be out of weapons.

The defense is not as shoddy as many claim.  True, it isn't the 
dominating unit of Pittsburgh or the Giants, but it isn't that far 
behind either.  The line is average, which makes it the weak point in 
this D.  The linebackers are led by standout Charles Haley.  The 
corners are pretty ehh, but the safeties are the best pair in the 
league, without a doubt.  FS Lott can do everything, and Waymer is the 
picks specialist, though he he can do everything too, just not as well 
as Lott.

Los Angeles has one of the most underrated offenses in the league.  
Unfortunately, their defense is very iffy, so this team will get 
involved in a lot of shootouts.

This offense is a poor man's San Francisco.  The wide receivers are 
just as good, the ground game is just as good, and the offensive line 
is just as good.  They lose a little bit of ground on the tight end 
speed, quarterback, and depth.  QB Everett does his job, mostly thanks 
to the help of WRs Ellard and Anderson.  TE Holohan can catch and block 
well, he just can't run.  The ground game is pretty good, especially 
seeing as how it's three running backs deep.  Take out Curt Warner (the 
running back, not the future league MVP quarterback) and replace him 
with Buford McGee, who has either the same or better statistics in 
every category, especially at receiving.

The defense is the Achilles heel of this team.  OLB Kevin Green is the 
only above average player on this entire defense, so take him out and 
it's clear sailing to the end zone.

Strength-13

The 'Aints have a one-dimensional offense and a strong but not strong 
enough defense.  They don't have any stars, and this hurts them 
greatly.

The powerful offensive line opens holes, which FB Craig "Ironhead" 
Heyward blasts open even farther.  Hilliard is a good back, and he's 
backed up by several other good backs.  The running game is the only 
part of the offense to fear.  The passing game is pathetic.  Walsh is 
bad, and, to make matters worse, he only has one guy to throw to in WR 
Martin.  The other wide receiver, Perriman, is crap, and neither the 
tight end nor the backs can catch well at all.  Nothing much can be 
done about this, because the depth at wide receiver is nothing special.

The defense, luckily, is much stronger than the offense.  The strength 
is in the line, where DE Turnbull and NT Wilks provide both a pass rush 
and run support.  The linebackers and secondary all even out to form an 
average unit.  No one player is worth mentioning, either as a strength 
or as a weakness.

Strength-21 (tied)

Overall, the Falcons are just a weak team.  They have a couple stars, 
and that's just about all that keeps them from complete ineptitude.

The Falcons' run-and-shoot system is not the best fit for them.  Put in 
a featured back set, with Rozier as the main back and running three 
plays.  Broussard fits as the other back.  Put Rison and Collins in as 
wide receivers, and put RB Tracy Johnson in at tight end.  Johnson 
can't catch well at all, but he can block.  When you pass, go for the 
wideouts, because the other three potential receivers can't catch very 
well.

The defense is gawdawful.  The line is average, but it can't make up 
for the poor linebacking corps.  The secondary is led by superstar (and 
superego)  CB Deion Sanders.  This defense won't soon win any awards.

(covered below).  If you want to hear the full version of the injury 
theme, which you only hear part of, it is number 24.

If you really want to find out who is the best Tecmoer, there is a code  
to make everyone in the playoffs the Buffalo Bills.  Get to the very 
end of a season, right after the last game.  If one of the divisions 
hasn't clinched yet, they will clinch immediately after the last game.  
Hit the reset button during one of these clinches and all the teams in 
the playoffs will be Buffalo.  Set the Bills on MAN and everyone can 
play as the same team.

First of all, there is another very well written Tecmo FAQ out 
there written by Leif Powers.  You can email him at 
HWPOWERS@prodigy.net or you can get a copy at GameFAQs.com at 
any time.  Where my guide covers teams and players, his covers plays 
and playbooks.  I strongly recommend checking it out if you liked this 
guide.  In addition, his can be used for any version of Tecmo, inluding 
Roms and patches.

The Tecmo Message Board is great for true Tecmo diehards.  It 
tends to be more alive during the pro football season, and the off-
season can be disappointing.  To see it at its best, check it out 
during the middle of the football season at 
www.insidetheweb.com/messageboard/mbs.cgi/mb5589

The Virginia Tech Tecmo Football League has an excellent site out 
there.  It's well-written and has some great humorous definitions.  It 
can be found at www.vttfl.com.

Lastly, I have written a small document named "You Know You Play Too 
Much Tecmo Super Bowl When..."  It's a humorous document with symptoms 
to check for if you don't know if you're an addict or just a fan.  You 
can get a copy by emailing me at edgarffvi@yahoo.com.
